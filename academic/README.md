- `tinyoloRT`: outputs of a rocket detection using Tiny YOLO on 4 videos, with two thresholds (0.1/0.5). The detection runs at 26 fps on the Jetson Nano thanks to TensorRT. The [tkDNN](https://github.com/ceccocats/tkDNN) tool was used.
- `trackers`: superpose three trackers (MOSSE, KCF, SiamRPN) on 4 videos.
